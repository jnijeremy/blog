title: Mac Configuration

---

My Mac configurations.

### shell
Somehow I end up having three shell configuration files: `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`.

Currently I use `zsh` and `Oh My ZSH`.

`.zshrc` is the only one in use and `zsh` doesn't load configuration from `.bash_rc` or `.bash_profile`.

### MAMP

Use MAMP as web development environemnt.

There is also a local MySQL which I don't use.

MAMP = Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Perl or Python
