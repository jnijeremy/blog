Currently I use a $40 BYOP plan with

* 4 GB DATA
* 1000 International Long Distance Minutes to 8 Selected Countries
* Unlimited British Columbia-Wide Minutes
* Unlimited Text, Picture and Video Messages from Canada to Canadian, U.S. and International Mobile Numbers
* Call Display
* Voicemail

The only issue with this plan is it doesn't have Fido Roaming.  Maybe need to use roammobility when in the US.
